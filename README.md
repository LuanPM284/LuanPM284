## Luan Patrick Machado 🛸

**`Junior Web Dev`**

I have a strong interest in new technologies such as cloud, data, and AI. One of my future goals is to become proficient in those areas and possibly create personal projects that would allow me to apply that knowledge. Always open to learning and hearing new ideas, I believe that my years studying physics allowed me to appreciate the feedback of others and the different ways someone can approach a problem.

I'm currently a Junior Web Developer trainee at BeCode, passionate about learning and building web applications. With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I'm eager to expand my expertise in React,
Node.js, Java, Python and others. I have experience working in fast-paced environments where adaptability and teamwork are key. My current goal is to apply my technical skills and problem-solving abilities in a challenging internship or junior
developer role. I am open to new opportunities where I can continue growing and contribute to meaningful projects.

Some of the projects I worked while at BeCode are a [cookieClicker](https://github.com/LuanPM284/cookieClicker) game, the first group project, and a Netflix clone named [GetFlix](https://github.com/anthosaxe/getflix), where the idea is to have the movies with the worst reviews.
