## **`Junior Developer`**
I have a strong interest in new technologies such as cloud computing, data, and AI. One of my future goals is to become proficient in those areas and possibly create personal projects that allow me to apply that knowledge. Always open to learning and hearing new ideas, I believe that my years studying physics have helped me appreciate feedback from others and the different ways someone can approach a problem.

<!--
I'm currently a Junior Web Developer trainee at BeCode, passionate about learning and building web applications. With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I'm eager to expand my expertise in React,
Node.js, Java, Python and others. I have experience working in fast-paced environments where adaptability and teamwork are key. My current goal is to apply my technical skills and problem-solving abilities in a challenging internship or junior
developer role. I am open to new opportunities where I can continue growing and contribute to meaningful projects.

Some of the projects I worked while at BeCode are a [cookieClicker](https://github.com/LuanPM284/cookieClicker) game, the first group project, and a Netflix clone named [GetFlix](https://github.com/anthosaxe/getflix), where the idea is to have the movies with the worst reviews.

My hobbies include reading and manga/anime. Some of my recent favorites are:

- Author: Brandon Sanderson
- Series: The Stormlight Archive
- Current Webnovel Obsession: The Wandering Inn and Shadow Slave
- Anime: One Piece, Frieren
- Manga/Manhwa: Dungeon Odyssey

<summary><h3>🚲 My coding journey</h3></summary>
My coding journey is just starting as I complete a junior web development bootcamp at BeCode. Before that, I had several years of university where I explored different areas, starting with Biomedical Sciences, then moving to Nursing, and eventually ending in Physics. I realized that the academic environment was not for me, even though I learned a lot and also developed many of my current ideals and work ethic. I had the opportunity to meet different people with different backgrounds and work with them while facing difficult classes and challenges.
\
The next step on my journey is the internship opportunity I had at DiVintage SPRL, where I was mentored by Senior Software Developer Ghislain Roggemans. The first steps I was given to understand were the importance of Clean Code, Test-Driven Development, and the MVVM architecture. From day one, I was given the opportunity to work on a real-world project where my small contributions would be visible or implemented after review and corrections. I had to learn new technologies such as Blazor, C#, and Visual Studio 2022, which I had never seen before starting this internship. My supervisor was always working and busy with his own projects and work but always set some time aside to check my progress, explain mistakes or suggest better ways to accomplish tasks that would take me hours in just a few minutes, and help prepare me for a future job. It was not easy, and from the first day, I was told by my supervisor that it would be hard, but that was the only way I would be sure to learn and leave better than when I started. Being able to work hard on challenging problems (for my level) allowed me to see just how much I have to learn and how working every day and continuing to learn would allow me to go farther than I thought possible when I started my coding career.
 \   
Coding always fascinated me, especially the idea of being able to build something by myself using the various tools available. Having the chance to learn new technologies or explore old ideas and methods to solve a problem keeps it interesting, even if most of the time it's hard to accomplish.
\
I still have much to learn and understand, but one thing I am sure of is that once I'm in the field and working hard, I will succeed at anything I set my mind to.
