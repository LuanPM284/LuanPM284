## **`Junior Dev`**
I have a strong interest in new technologies such as cloud, data, and AI. One of my future goals is to become proficient in those areas and possibly create personal projects that would allow me to apply that knowledge. Always open to learning and hearing new ideas, I believe that my years studying physics allowed me to appreciate the feedback of others and the different ways someone can approach a problem.

<!--
I'm currently a Junior Web Developer trainee at BeCode, passionate about learning and building web applications. With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I'm eager to expand my expertise in React,
Node.js, Java, Python and others. I have experience working in fast-paced environments where adaptability and teamwork are key. My current goal is to apply my technical skills and problem-solving abilities in a challenging internship or junior
developer role. I am open to new opportunities where I can continue growing and contribute to meaningful projects.

Some of the projects I worked while at BeCode are a [cookieClicker](https://github.com/LuanPM284/cookieClicker) game, the first group project, and a Netflix clone named [GetFlix](https://github.com/anthosaxe/getflix), where the idea is to have the movies with the worst reviews.

My hobbies include reading and manga/anime. Some of my recent favorites are:

- Author: Brandon Sanderson
- Series: The Stormlight Archive
- Current Webnovel Obsession: The Wandering Inn and Shadow Slave
- Anime: One Piece, Frieren
- Manga/Manhwa: Dungeon Odyssey

I'm a **Junior Software Developer** passionate about web and software development, clean code, and learning new technologies. 
During my internship at **DiVintage SPRL**, I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects that strengthened my skills in **C#, Blazor, .NET, and front-end development**. 
I enjoy building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications while continuously improving my coding practices.

<summary><h3>🚲 My coding journey</h3></summary>
My coding journey is just starting as I complete a Junior Web Dev bootcamp at BeCode. Before that, I had several years of university where I explored different areas, going from Biomedical Sciences, Nursing, and ending at Physics. I ended up noticing that the academic environment was not for me, even if I ended up learning a lot and also developed many of my current ideals and work ethic. I had the opportunity to meet different people with different backgrounds and work with them while facing hard classes and challenges.
          
Coding always fascinated me, especially the idea of being able to build something by myself using the different tools available. Having the chance to learn new technologies or old ideas and methods to solve a problem keeps it interesting, even if most of the times it's hard to accomplish.

I still have much to learn and understand, but one thing I can be sure of is that once I'm in the field and working hard, I will succeed at anything that I put my mind to.
